# Nuclone expansion board
Nuclone expansion board with UART connector and pin test pads, basis for many development boards
# HSI (Hardware Software Interface)
This applies to a project that has a embedded software component. Describe what each pin/bus does, what it is connected to, what its function is and some "safe" behaviour when starting up.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* Fill in HSI
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
This is a list of hardware components. If just mentioned a generic component like a 1K 0402 resistor, just name it as such, free to substitute. If you need some special integrated IC's show some sources like Mouser, Digikey, Farnell, or LCSC
